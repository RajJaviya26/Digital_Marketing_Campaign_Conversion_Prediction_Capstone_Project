# Digital_Marketing_Campaign_Conversion_Prediction_Capstone_ProjectProject Overview
This project aims to predict the conversion rates of digital marketing campaigns based on various features such as user demographics, campaign types, and engagement metrics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can identify factors that contribute to successful conversions, enabling marketers to optimize their strategies.

Objectives
Analyze the impact of different features on conversion rates.
Develop predictive models to estimate conversion likelihood.
Provide actionable insights for improving marketing campaigns.


Modeling Techniques
This project utilizes several machine learning algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression
SVM
Decision Trees
Random Forest
ADA boost
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
bagging Classifier

Each model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Results
The models' performance metrics will be displayed in the output. Key findings will include:

Feature importance analysis
Model comparison charts
Recommendations for marketing strategies based on the predictions
Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into digital marketing campaigns and offers predictive capabilities to enhance conversion rates. Future work may include deploying the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
